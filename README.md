## Anonymous Sudan

Anonymous Sudan claims to be a pro-Islamist hacktivist group fighting against the injustices being carried out over Muslims across the world. They have attacked several countries as retaliation citing incidents of misbehavior against the Islamic culture.

Deeper analysis has revealed that the group appears to be a Russian front for targetting NATO members to cause disruption in NATO and and create complications in Sweden's admission to NATO. Since 8th April 2023, their major target has been India and Israel.

Following up with Anonymous Sudan, several hacker groups from neighboring countries with Muslim population have joined forces with them to conduct co-ordinated attacks on websites belonging to the Indian government organizations, airports, healthcare institutions and small and medium enterprises.
